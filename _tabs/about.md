### Hello, reader!

Hi! Welcome to my hidden portfolio? blog? notebook? I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at Stony Brook University interested in Cybersecurity. I havn't yet figured out which aspect of cybersecurity is the most interesting so stay tuned. I make posts about projects I've completed, CTFs / Hackathons I've done, and other cool accomplishments.

### Certifications

CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) - just kidding, not yet, but coming ASAP!
