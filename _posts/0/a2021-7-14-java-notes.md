Note: I tried my best to make this in my own words. Just for an easy reference and for my memory

## Some Notes on Classes

Note: Inner classes do exist. Most useful when a class is only used by one other class. It just makes sense to keep them together. "Increases encapsulation" (a good thing).

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to hiding variables within a class, only accessible by methods of the class (getters/setters)

Example: Notice how balance is private. It can only be accessed with the getBalance() method

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// by sololearn 
class BankAccount {
  private double balance = 0;
  public void withdraw(double x) {
    if(balance >= x) {
      balance -= x;
    }
  }
  
  public double getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Benefits:
- Better control the way class data is accessed or modified
- Ability to change one part of the code without affecting other parts

### Inheritance

Inheritance refers to one class gaining the properites of another (variables & methods) 

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// by sololearn
class Animal {
  protected int legs;
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Animal eats");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  Dog() {
    legs = 4;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Above you can see how the Dog subclass has the legs attribute because it extends the Animal superclass.

Note: The "protected" keywords makes legs ONLY visible to the subclasses

Note 2: Constructors are not inherited, but they are called. For example, creating a Dog class would call the constructor of Animal

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to a superclass having multiple subclasses with unique method implementations.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// by sololearn
class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Grr...");
  }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Meow");
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Woof");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, Cat and Dog extend the Animal class, and each have their own implementation of makeSound()

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
public static void main(String[ ] args) {
  Animal a = new Dog();
  Animal b = new Cat();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note: Notice how you can use the Animal variable to create a Dog or Cat class.

### Method overriding (runtime polymorphism)

Method overriding refers to creating a unique implementation of a superclass method.

In the example above, Cat and Dog each override the makeSound() method

Rules for Method Overriding (by Sololearn):
- Should have the same return type and arguments
- The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level (Example: If the superclass method is declared public, the overriding method in the sub class can be neither private nor protected)
- A method declared final or static cannot be overridden
- If a method cannot be inherited, it cannot be overridden
- Constructors cannot be overridden

### Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)

Method overloading refers to creating a method of the same name, but with different parameters.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}

public int getMax(int a, int b) {}

public double getMax(double a, double b) {}

{% endhighlight %}

### Abstraction

"The concept of abstraction is that we focus on essential qualities, rather than the specific characteristics of one particular example."

In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

These classes CANNOT be instantiated, they must be inherited

{% highlight javascript linenos %}

abstract class Animal {
  int legs = 0;
  abstract void makeSound();
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Note: The abstract method makeSound() has no implementation

### Interfaces

An interface is an abstract class with ONLY abstract methods. Methods are implicity abstract and public.

May only have static final variables

A class can only extend one superclass, but MANY interfaces. Interfaces can extend interfaces.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}

interface Animal {
    public void eat();
    public void makeSound();
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("omnomnom");
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

All methods must be overridden.

### Type Casting

Assigning a value of one type (int, for example) to a variable of another type (double, for example)

{% highlight javascript linenos %}

int a = (int) 3.14;

{% endhighlight %}

3.14 was casted to an integer.

#### Upcasting

Refers to casting an instance of a subclass to its superclass

{% highlight javascript linenos %}

Animal a = new Cat();

{% endhighlight %}

Java automatically upcasted the Cat type variable to the Animal type.

#### Downcasting

Refers to casting an object of a superclass to its subclass

Note: Think going down, super -> sub, opposite of Upcasting, which is sub -> super

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
Animal a = new Cat();
((Cat)a).makeSound();
{% endhighlight %}

Note: Upcasting can never fail, but Downcasting can. Think about it, Cat has to be an Animal, because it inherits Animal and is created from it. Animal, however, doesn't have to be a Cat. It could be a Dog.

### Anonymous Classes

Anonymous classes refer to changing a classes method on the fly, upon creation.

Consider the following, where a Machine class exist with a Start() method

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
class Program {
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
        Machine m = new Machine() {
            @Override public void start() {
                System.out.println("Wooooo");
            }
        };
        m.start();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, you are overriding the start() method upon creation. This implementation of the start() method will only exist for that class.

### Enums

Enums are a special type that define constants that are members of a fixed set

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
enum Rank {
  SOLDIER,
  SERGEANT,
  CAPTAIN
}

Rank a = Rank.SOLDIER;
{% endhighlight %}

Useful when a variable can only have a certain, predefined, number of options. Ex: Days of a week

## Exception Handling

### Try / Catch

Exception handling is great for catching runtime bugs and preventing them from destroying the program.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}

try {
  int a = 5 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
  System.out.println("Error");
} finally {
  // will run no matter what
}

{% endhighlight %}

Note: The (Exception e) statement in the catch block is used to catch all possible Exceptions. This can be made to something more specific.

Also note the finally keyword

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
try {
  //some code
} catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
  //Catch block
} catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
  //Catch block
} catch (ExceptionType3 e3) {
  //Catch block
}
{% endhighlight %}

There are many ExceptionTypes, such as ArithmeticException

Note: All catch blocks should be ordered from most specific to most general.

### throws

The throws keyword can be used in methods for exception handling

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
public class Program {

    static int div(int a, int b) throws ArithmeticException {
        if(b == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by Zero");
        } else {
            return a / b;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(div(42, 0));
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

### Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

Checked exceptions prevent your code from compiling, and must be fixed. Typically underlined red in an IDE

Unchecked exceptions occur during runtime, such as ArithmeticException

## Threads

There are two ways to create threads.

The preferred way is to use an Interface so that you still have the option to extend a class.

Class:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
class Loader extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
        Loader obj = new Loader();
        obj.start();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Interface:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
class Loader implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new Loader());
        t.start();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
